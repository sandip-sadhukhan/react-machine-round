# Star Rating Component
Design and implement a "Star Rating" component using React.

Requirements:

- Ensure the component is fully functional and displays a visual representative of a star rating system, with 5 starts that users can click to set a rating.
- Enhance the component to be more user-friendly and visually appealing. This can involve adding the hover effect, or changing star icons' appearance when active/hovered.
- Write a component in a way that it can easily be reused across different parts of an application and can accept different sizes, current rating, etc for the starts as props.
